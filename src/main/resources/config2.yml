  # Let playerStatFilesLoadedInOnStartup = n
  # Your server will load in at most n player files asynchronously into memory at start-up. These are the last n people to log out of the server (or just random people before the list is created).
  # If your server has less than n player files, ALL of the files will be loaded in on start-up asynchronously
  # Loading in many players may help with performance issues if your server has high frequency of logins
  # The cost is RAM, each player takes up <= 10KB of ram, so loading in the default (100) players will cost <= 1MB of server RAM that will only be used once the player logs on

tokens:
  #For any option with "per" in the name:
  # If set to a decimal (ex. x = 0.4), the server will give the player t = floor(level/x) - floor((oldLevel)/x) tokens
  # In other words,the player will get 1/x tokens per level ON AVERAGE
  #Example 1:
  # levelsPerPassiveToken: = .666
  # Level from 0 to 1 => t = floor(1/.666) - floor(0/.666) = 1 - 0 = 1 token rewarded at leveling 0 -> 1
  # Level from 1 to 2 => t = floor(2/.666) - floor(1/.666) = 3 - 1 = 2 tokens rewarded from leveling 1 -> 2
  # Level from 30 to 100 => t = floor(100/.666) - floor(30/.666) = 150 - 45 = 105
  # As you can see, this is identical to getting 1.5 tokens per level on average, which is the value of 1/x
