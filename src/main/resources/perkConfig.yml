# Welcome to FreeRPG!
# Support Discord: https://discord.gg/uAJXCnX
#
# This file is intended to be large and allow the ability to change the properties are various skills
#
# Some experience drops are in this file, but most are in experienceConfig.yml
#
#
# CUSTOM DROP INFORMATION:
# ***There are lots of properties of a custom item, and they get fairly complicated. Below is information on how to make a custom item/drop****
# Only Material is required, everything else is optional
# All possible properties of an item:
#
# 1) ***REQUIRED*** MATERIAL: The name of the item.
#    [TAGS] item, drop, output
#    [EXAMPLE] drop: PINK_BED
#    [NOTES] Select from https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
#            If a material is NOT recognized, it will simply not be considered (ex. NETHERITE_SCRAP in MC v1.15 will be ignored)
#
# 2) AMOUNT: The amount of the item dropped.
#    [TAGS] amount
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] 1
#    [EXAMPLE] amount: 2
#    [NOTES] Must be an integer. For a random amount, you can list multiple occurences of an item on a drop table.
#
# 3) DURABILITY: The percent durability of an item. Uniform random choice between the upper and lower bound provided.
#    [TAGS] durability, durabilityModifier
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] [lower: 1.00, upper: 1.00]
#    [EXAMPLE 1] durability: [lower: 0.10, upper: 1.00]
#    [EXAMPLE 2] durability: [lower: 0.20]
#    [NOTES] This tag is ignored if the item is not breakable (ex. carrot). An item will always have at least 1 durability if dropped, regardless of input.
#            lower and upper both have default values of 1.00. Therefore, [lower: 0.20] == [lower: 0.20, upper: 1.00]
#
# 4) ENCHANTMENT: The possible levels an item could be enchanted with and whether or not it's a treasure enchantment.
#    [TAGS] randomEnchantment, enchantmentBounds
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] [lower: 0, upper: 0, isTreasure: true]
#    [EXAMPLE] enchantmentBounds: [lower: 10, upper: 20, isTreasure: false]
#    [NOTES] This tag is ignored if the item cannot be enchanted in vanilla minecraft (ex. carrot). Treasure enchants follow these mechanics: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanting_mechanics#Treasure
#            lower and upper both have default values of 0.
#            isTreasure has default value of true.
#
# 5) STATIC ENCHANTMENTS: Enchantments that will always be on a drop.
#    [TAGS] staticEnchantments, enchantments
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] [[]] (None)
#    [EXAMPLE 1] staticEnchantments: [[enchant: LUCK_OF_THE_SEA, level: 2],[enchant: LURE, level: 3]]
#    [EXAMPLE 2] enchantments: [[enchant: FIRE_PROTECTION, level: 2]]
#    [NOTES] Enchantments are unsafe, so any item and any enchantment can be applied (ex. Sharpness VII carrot).
#            The enchantments must be spelled as seen in english minecraft, with underscores replacing spaces.
#            Multiple enchantments can be listed, even if they are mutually exclusive. (ex. Fortune and Silk Touch)
#            If an enchantment is not specified, the entry is ignored.
#            If an enchantment is specified, level has a default value of 1.
#
# 6) POTION EFFECTS: The potion effects added to an item.
#    [TAGS] potion, potionEffect,
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] [[]] (None)
#    [EXAMPLE 1] potionEffect: [[effect: SPEED, level: 3, duration: 30, color: (100,125,55]]
#    [EXAMPLE 2] potion: [[effect: SPEED, level: 3, duration: 30, color: (255,255,255)], [effect: JUMP, level: 2, duration: 60]]
#    [EXAMPLE 3] potion: [effect: WATER]
#    [EXAMPLE 4] potion: [effect: INSTANT_HEAL, isUpgraded: true]
#    [EXAMPLE 5] potionEffect: [effect: SPEED, isExtended: true]
#    [NOTES] There are two types of potions:
#            1) Default minecraft potions (potionType) which can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionType.html
#            2) Custom effect potions (potionEffectType) which can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html
#            If you wish to make a default minecraft potion, do something like example 3,4, or 5. If you wish to make a custom potion, do something similiar to example 1 or 2.
#            Case 1) and 2) are differentiated by the number of brackets.
#            In case 2) multiple effects can be listed, so there are two sets of brackets (like this: "[[...],[...],...,[...]]")
#            In case 1) only one vanilla effect can be given to a potion, so there is only one set of brackets (like this "[...]")
#            The level, duration, and color tags only apply to custom effect potions. They will be ignored otherwise.
#            The isUpgraded and isExtended tags only apply to vanilla potions. They will be ignored otherwise.
#            If the material is not "POTION", this entry is ignored.
#            level has a default value of 1
#            duration has a default value of 0
#            color is ignored if not supplied. When a potion has multiple colors specified, those colors are mixed. If no color is supplied, a default color is used based on the effects.
#            isExtended has a default value of false
#            isUpgraded has a default value of true
#
# 7) WEIGHT: the relative probabilistic weight that something drops
#    [TAGS] weight
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] 1
#    [EXAMPLE] weight: 100
#    [NOTES] The relative chance that an item will drop (relative to other weights of items in the drop table).
#            The drop percentage formula is as follow:
#            (1 - sum of static probabilites) * (weight)/(sum of all weights)
#            This property of an item is not always relevant (ex. this will do nothing if added to an item in a crafting recipe)
#            Weights CAN be decimals, despite the fact that I always use integers.
#
# 8) PROBABILITY: The rate at which an item drops
#    [TAGS] prob, probability, staticProbability
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] 1
#    [EXAMPLE] prob: 0.001
#    [NOTES] This is the static probability that an item drops within a drop table. This probability is unaffected by changing weights.
#            As a result, item drops will not perform proprely if the sum of all static probabilities used is greater than 1.
#            The drop percentage formula is as follow:
#            (1 - sum of static probabilites) * (weight)/(sum of all weights)
#            This property of an item is not always relevant (ex. this will do nothing if added to an item in a crafting recipe)
#            Static probability will override weight.
#
# 9) EXPERIENCE: The amount of experience rewarded when the item is given.
#    [TAGS] exp, experience
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] 0
#    [EXAMPLE] exp: 500
#    [NOTES] The exp drop is given for the skill the item is under. For now, you cannot give mining experience for something under digging, for example.
#
# 10) NAME: The item name given to the item
#    [TAGS] name, itemName
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] None
#    [EXAMPLE] name: "The Pickaxe"
#    [NOTES] The name can use alternate color codes.
#            For example: "&4ADMIN ITEM" should display in red
#
# EXAMPLES OF CUSTOM ITEMS:
# 1) [drop: COAL, amount: 1, exp: 200,  weight: 500]
# 2) [drop: IRON_HELMET, exp: 1750, weight: 1, durability: [upper: 0.00, lower: 0.85], enchantmentBounds: [upper: 30, lower: 30], weight: 30,  staticEnchantments: [[enchant: RESPIRATION, level: 3]]]
# 3) [item: POTION, amount: 1, exp: 0, potion: [effect: INSTANT_HEAL, isUpgraded: true]]
# 4) [drop: DIAMOND_SWORD, amount: 1, name="FreeRPG Item"]
#
#
#
# CUSTOM EFFECTS INFORMATION:
# ***There are lots of properties of a custom effect, and they get fairly complicated. Below is information on how to make a custom effect****
# Effect, level, and duration are usually required. There are some specially cases that are commented.
# All possible properties of an item:
#
# 1) EFFECT: The effect given.
#    [TAGS] effect, potionEffect
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] (None)
#    [EXAMPLE] effect: CONDUIT_POWER
#    [NOTES] Select from https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html.
#
# 2) LEVEL: The level of the effect given.
#    [TAGS] level, effectLevel, potionLevel
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] 1
#    [EXAMPLE] level: 2
#    [NOTES] Must be an integer. For a random amount, you can list multiple occurences of an item on a drop table.
#
# 3) DURATION: The duration of the effect in seconds.
#    [TAGS] duration, length
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] 0
#    [EXAMPLE] duration: 100
#    [NOTES] Duration can be a decimal, but is rounded to the nearest tick (0.05 s)
#
# 4) DELAY: The delay between the event that causes the effect and the entity recieving the effect in seconds
#    [TAGS] delay
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] 0
#    [EXAMPLE] delay: 1.5
#    [NOTES] Delay can be a decimal, but is rounded to the nearest tick (0.05 s)
#
# 5) PROBABILITY: The probability this specific effect is given
#    [TAGS] prob, probability
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] 1.0
#    [EXAMPLE] probability: 0.05
#    [NOTES] effectChance is the chance that the perk activates, while the probabilities in effectsGiven are the chances that particular
#            effect is added (given that the perk activated).
#
# 6) DURATION MULTIIPLIER: The multiplier used to determine the duration of this effect relative to the duration of another effect.
#    [TAGS] durationMultiplier, relativeDuration
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] 1.0
#    [EXAMPLE] durationMultiplier: 0.5
#    [NOTES] This overrides the duration tag, but won't have any effect if not specified in the commenting for the perk.
#            The formula for time when using this tag is:
#            (Other effect duration)*(duration multiplier) + duration added (see 8)
#
# 7) DURATION ADDED: The duration added to an effect when the effect's length is relative to the duration of another effect
#    [TAGS] durationAdded, relativeDurationAdded
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] 0
#    [EXAMPLE] durationAdded: 10.0
#    [NOTES] This overrides the duration tag, but won't have any effect if not specified in the commenting for the perk.
#            The formula for time when using this tag is:
#            (Other effect duration)*(duration multiplier) + duration added (see 7)
#
#
# EXAMPLES OF CUSTOM EFFECTS:
# 1) [effect: DOLPHINS_GRACE,    level: 1, duration: 10.0, delay: 0.0, prob: 1.0]
# 2) [effect: HEALTH_BOOST,      level: 3, duration: 25.0]
# 3) [effect: STRENGTH, level: 2, relativeDuration: 1.0]
#
# RECIPES INFORMATION:
#
# 1) **REQUIRED** OUTPUT: The crafting recipe's output item
#    [TAGS] output. result
#    [EXAMPLE] output: [item: ENCHANTED_BOOK, amount: 1, enchantments: [[enchant: POWER, level: 1]] ]
#    [NOTES] This node should be a custom item, see above for custom item formatting.
#            DO NOT set random durabilities/enchantments on these items. They will be rolled once when the server boots up,
#            and will change every time the plugin is reloaded.
#
# 2) **REQUIRED** RECIPE: The materials that make up the recipe
#    [TAGS] recipe, craftingGrid
#    [EXAMPLE] recipe: [AIR,AIR,AIR,AIR,PAPER,PAPER,AIR,PAPER,IRON_PICKAXE]
#    [NOTES] A recipe is a list of ingredients formatted as such:
#            - (1) top left

#            [top left, top middle, top right, middle left, middle middle, middle right, middle right, bottom left, bottom middle, bottom right]
#            Use "AIR" to represent blank entries
#
# 3) MINECRAFT XP COST: The number of minecraft levels required to craft the item
#    [TAGS] xpCost, experienceCost
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] 0
#    [EXAMPLE] xpCost: 1
#    [NOTES] This scales linearly with the number of items crafted (ex. crafting 2 of the recipe will cost 2 * xpCost levels)
#
# EXAMPLES:
# 1) - output: [item: ENCHANTED_BOOK, amount: 1, enchantments: [[enchant: MENDING, level: 1]] ]
